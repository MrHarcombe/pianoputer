This repository contains a fork of Zulko's original "Pianoputer" which expects to find a RaspberryPi hooked up to an ultrasonic distance sensor (an HC-SR04), to work like a theremin.

From Zulko's original post:

"To play you first need to install Python, and the Python libraries Numpy, Scipy and Pygame. Agreed, the dependencies are a little heavy.

Then you just unzip everything in a folder and run this line:

    python pianoputer.py --wav clarinet-middle-c.wav

Enjoy !"
